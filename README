http://forja.cenatic.es/scm/?group_id=197

It includes tools and instructions to build packages for the most
common operating systems.

BUILDING FROM SOURCE
-------------------
Please see the wiki page for building from source for any given os:
 
https://forja.cenatic.es/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/iteexe/index.php/
  
Each operating system supported by exe has a folder in the installs 
directory that generates an os specific installer.


WINDOWS
=======
If you download the sources, installs/windows/README
will five you the information you need to buid an executive package.
Or you can download the package from http://forja.cenatic.es/frs/?group_id=197

INSTALLATION
------------
- Download eXe-install-X.YY.exe, double click it to launch the installer,
  and then follow the instructions. 
- You will be asked what directory to install eXe in.  The default will
  normally be fine.  (You should always use the same directory when
  installing a new version of eXe.)
- The installer will create an eXe icon on the desktop and a menu-item under
  "All Programs".

RUNNING
-------
Double click on the shortcut on the desktop to launch eXe.

To close eXe you must use the File... Quit menu item.  Do not simply try
to close the eXe display window with the window close button.  Remember to
save your content before exiting.

To install eXe, simply open the .dmg and drag the app to your 
Applications folder.


FEDORA LINUX 
=============
The eXe Fedora Linux install consists of a single RPM. 

There are HowTos on http://exelearning.net/ explaining how you can use
these RPMs on some other RPM-based Linux distributions.

From the command line type exe to start.  If you are using a standard
window manager, you should find an eXe entry in your Accessories menu.


DEBIAN/UBUNTU LINUX 
===================
If you download the sources, installs/debian/ubuntu/README
will five you the information you need to buid an executive package.

Note for users of localepurge
-----------------------------
Since version 2.1 we use the FHS directories for the locales. Therefore, 
localepurge will delete all the locales you don't save explicitly.
If you use localepurge, please pay attention to the languages you are
interested in keeping.
